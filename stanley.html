    <div class="description"><h2>Stanley Hudson</h2>
        <p style="font-size:2vw;">Stanley is a tough man to please, and like most Capricorns, you're sometimes pessimistic and stubborn in situations. Make no mistake, you're practical and wise which makes others look up to you. Like Stanely, you're very passionate about your interests and are an independent individual.
