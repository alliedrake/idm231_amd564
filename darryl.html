    <div class="description"><h2>Daryll Philbin</h2>
        <p style="font-size:2vw;">You're the person that holds everything down, just as Daryll does whether it's in the warehouse or in the office. You're patient when it comes to dealing with the people around you, and although sometimes you find yourself being stubborn, you stay persistent and act as a friend that people can rely on.</p></div>
